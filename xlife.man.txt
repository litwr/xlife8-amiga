\bNAME

 \gXlife - Conway's Game of Life and other cellular automata for  the Commodore
Amiga, Workbench OS.

\bDESCRIPTION

 \gThe program helps the user play with John Horton Conway's "Life" game.

\bCOMMANDS

 \x!  Place random cells on the area of the universe on the screen.
 \x%  Set a percentage density for a randomly filled area.  Default is 42%.
 \x+  Zoom the view in. This mode is faster for big patterns and slower for the
    \gthe small ones.
 \x-  Zoom the view out.
 \x.  Place the cursor to the center of the universe.
 \x?  Help for xlife.
 \xB  Benchmark.  Enter a number of generations and get time.  This also provi-
    \gdes a way for the fastest evolution.
 \xC  Clear the universe.
 \xE  Toggle pseudocolor display mode. In this mode, new cells are shown in the
    \gextra color.  It is slightly slower.
 \xg  Toggle running the game. Evolve/Stop. Then step through generations until
    \gsomething exceptional happens, like no live cells or a key pressed.
 \xh  (Hide) stop displaying after each generation. This mode is up to 10% fas-
    \gter than established by g-command in the zoomed out mode.
 \xl  Load (actually add) pattern to the universe from  a file.  This lets  you
    \goverlay multiple saved states to make for some interesting effects. Load-
    \ged pattern is (default) initially considered  tentative,  and maybe mani-
    \gpulated in various ways before incorporating it into  main  pattern.  (To
    \gindicate this, it's  surrounded by a bounding box.)  Clear the   universe
    \gif you want to start from scratch. It is possible either to select a pat-
    \gtern in the directory list directly or to enter a pattern  name.  A  file
    \gmay be only taken from the \pXlife8/PATTERNS\n\g subdirectory of the root dire-
    \gctory on any disk.
 \xL  Immediately reload, at the cursor, a copy of the last pattern loaded.  It
    \gdoesn't work for ramdisk patterns.
 \xo  Forward one generation.
 \xQ  Quit.
 \xR  Change the (2-state) rules in "stays alive on" / "born on".  The standard
    \grules are 23/3 (alive on two or three neighbors, birth on three neighbors
    \gfor an empty cell).
 \xS  Save the universe to a file. It is correct to save to an existed file but
    \gno warning message is provided.
 \xT  Set up the topology.  It is possible to use the rectangular area with the
    \gconnected edges (anchor ring, tore) or the rectangular plain.
 \xv  View current pattern information.
 \xV  View comments to a file.
 \xX  Reload palette from the file "colors.cfg".  This file is loaded automati-
    \gcally when the program starts.
 \xZ  Set and optionally save a palette.

 \gUse (\ushift\n\g +) \ucursor\n\g,  \uHome\n\g,  and  \u.\n\g keys to  move  the  cursor.  Use
 \g\uspace bar\n\g to change the cell under cursor.  You can also use mouse to draw
 \gand remove cells.

\bSTATUS BAR

 \gIt shows the number of generations,  the total sum of live cells,  the slow-
 \gness indicator (100% means the maximum slowness), the rules,  and the cursor
 \gcoordinates.

\bLIMITS

 \gIt is possible to see only  up to 999 files from  the disk directory.  Use a
 \gmask to show only matched files.

 \gThe tentative pattern may show only up to 8192 cells.  The other  cells  are
 \gnot shown but loaded later.  This quantity is enough to show every cell from
 \ga pattern file with the size that is equal approximately to 16 KB.

 \gThe universe size is 248x192.

 \gThe rules with "born on" condition 0 are not supported.

 \gFiles on ramdisk are without comments.

\bFORMATS

 \gThe first two bytes of a pattern file are its width and height. The next two
 \gbytes describes "stay alive on" condition, and the next two - "born on". The
 \gnext contents are  the sequence of  X and Y coordinate pairs of  live cells.
 \gThe patterns must have \p8XL\n\g filename extension.  This format is identical  to
 \gthe format for Xlife-8 for the IBM PC.

 \gA file with comments must have  the same name as  the corresponding  pattern
 \gfilename.  A comment file is a common plain text file.  It may be edited  by
 \gany text editor.

\bUsing the "lifeconv" utility

 \gThis utility from Xlife main sources may convert CELLS, LIF, L, RLE, and MCL
 \gformats. It may be used from any relative to Unix OS or  from Microsoft Win-
 \gdows.  The \plifeconv\n\g utility takes a pattern name as an argument.  It  writes
 \ga file to standard output that contains an equivalent version of the pattern
 \gin a different format.  Usage is:

   \g\plifeconv pattern -4 >destination\n\g

 \gwhere destination is any valid file name.  The "-4" option sets  the  format
 \gfor 8-bit Xlife for the destination file is written.  In  Microsoft  Windows
 \genvironment (Mingw Xlife port) the sign ">" must be omitted.

 \gA file produced may be directly used with this Xlife. The  appropriate  com-
 \gment file should have the same name as \p8xl\n\g-file, the \ptxt\n\g-extension,  and its
 \gcontent may be any textual data.


\bRAMDISK

\g It contains 10 patterns:

\g\pglider gun\n\g  The Gosper glider gun is the first  known  gun,  and  indeed  the
        \gfirst known finite pattern  with  unbounded  growth,  found  by  Bill
        \gGosper in November 1970.

\g\psmall fish\n\g the lightweight spaceship (or LWSS) is the  smallest  orthogonally
        \gmoving spaceship, and the second  most common spaceship. Random soups
        \gwill emit one LWSS for approximately every 615 gliders.  It moves  at
        \gc/2 and has period 4.

\g\pHWSS\n\g    the heavyweight spaceship is the fourth most common ship.

\g\pr-pentomino\n\g a methuselah that was found by John Conway in 1970.  It is by far
        \gthe most active polyomino with fewer  than  six  cells;  all  of  the
        \gothers stabilize in at most 10 generations, but the R-pentomino  does
        \gnot do so until generation 1103, by which time it has a population of
        \g116.  The glider it releases in generation 69,  was  the first glider
        \gever observed.

\g\pbunnies\n\g, \plidka\n\g, \pacorn\n\g methuselahs with 17332,  29055,  5206 generations life-
        \gspan respectively.

\g\pbig glider\n\g The big glider was found by Dean Hickerson  in December  1989  and
        \gwas the first known  diagonal spaceship other than the glider.

\g\pbi-gun\n\g  a double-barreled glider gun, a glider  generator.  It  produces  two
        \ggliders for 46 generations.

\g\pblock-laying switch engine\n\g  a puffer train which travels diagonally  at  c/12
        \gtowards the upper left with  a period of 96.  This  is  the  smallest
        \gknown object which grows without bound.  It produces eight new blocks
        \gevery 288 generations.

\bEXPLORATION

\g Here are some 2-state rules to experiment with:

  \g\p23/3\n\g        the default, of course; Conway's "Life" rules

  \g\p1234/3\n\g      patterns "crystallize"

  \g\p12345/45\n\g    patterns become contained

  \g\p12345/4\n\g     same as above, but settles VERY quickly

  \g\p5/12\n\g        floor  tile patterns...  Variations of this tend to be  intere-
              \gsting as well

  \g\p1357/1357\n\g   replicators world...

  \g\p/2\n\g          seeds - most patterns  expand  indefinitely,  some  interesting
              \gones.  Fast gliders

  \g\p012345678/3\n\g life without  death.  Ladders

\bFILES

  \g\pcolors.cfg\n\g   this file contains the palette. It's binary file. May be omit-
              \gted.

  \g\pcr.txt\n\g       the text  file  with  copyright  and  historical  information.
              \gShould not be omitted!
